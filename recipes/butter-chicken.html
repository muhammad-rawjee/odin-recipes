	<ol>
		<li>In a medium bowl, combine the tandoori masala, ginger, garlic, and yogurt. 
			Whisk until smooth, adjust seasonings to preference. Add the chicken and allow to 
			marinate for at least 20 minutes and ideally for 12-24 hours, covered 
			in the refrigerator.</li>
		
		<li>Heat the ghee in a dutch oven or heavy bottom pot over medium heat. 
			Add the onions and sauté until they turn translucent and start to sweat, 
			about 5-7 minutes, don't allow the onions to brown. Add ginger and garlic paste 
			and let cook for 30 seconds, stirring so it doesn't burn. Add the can of 
			crushed tomatoes along with the chili powder, coriander powder, and 
			cumin powder and continue to cook for 5 minutes, if the mixture starts 
			bubbling rapidly, add about ¼ cup of water and continue to cook.</li>
		
		<li>Remove from heat, add the mixture to a blender and blend until smooth, 
			you may need to add a couple water to help it blend (up to ¼ cup). 
			Depending on how powerful your blender is, you may want to blend the mixture in two batches. 
			Remember to hold the lid of the blender down with a kitchen towel when blending, 
			to avoid accidents.</li>
		
		<li>Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the dutch oven over medium heat. 
			Add the marinated chicken (discard any excess marinade) and cook for about 5-6 minutes, 
			stirring as required to brown all sides. Add the butter chicken sauce to the pot and heat everything through. 
			Once it starts to bubble, add the cream and garam masala. When the sauce regains a simmer, 
			add the crushed fenugreek leaves. Serve over basmati rice or with naan.</li>
